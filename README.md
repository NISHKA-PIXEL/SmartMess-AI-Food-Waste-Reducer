### AI-Powered Hostel Food Waste Reduction System

SmartMess is an AI-driven solution designed to reduce food waste in hostel messes
by capturing real-time student meal intent and combining it with historical food
and waste data to generate accurate cooking recommendations.

## 🚨 Problem
Hostel messes prepare food without knowing actual student attendance, leading to
daily overproduction, wastage, and increased operational costs.

## 💡 Solution
SmartMess introduces a human-in-the-loop AI system where:
- Students confirm meal intent with one tap
- Mess staff log food preparation and waste
- AI refines demand predictions BEFORE cooking

## 🔑 Key Features
- One-tap student meal voting
- AI-based demand prediction
- Mess dashboard with quantity recommendations
- Food waste tracking and analytics

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting)
- Google Cloud Functions / Cloud Run
- AI/ML for demand estimation (MVP / conceptual)

## 📦 Project Status
This repository represents the MVP structure and ongoing development
for the SmartMess system.
